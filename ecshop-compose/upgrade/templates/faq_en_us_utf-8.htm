Ask：Does the upgrade program depend on the client environment very much?<br />
Answer：In order to prevent the server side timeout, in order to support an unlimited version upgrade, we move "Loop and jumps
" out of the client side ，so your browser should support JavaScript1.5+. This demand simply negligible on the time that the IE7 has released long age and the FF2 is in fashion.<br /><br />

Ask：The version of my ECSHOP is very low, then too big the datasize, does the upgrade program supply "insurance" to these?<br />

Ask：I am a programer，i do some change on the data list structure, can it effect the upgrading?<br />
Answer：The program think about kinds of abnormalities already, even if you change the data list structure, the process of upgrade program also can going fluently.

Ask：The program show that there is alot of wrong clearly, but it goes on upgrading, is it OK?<br />
